One way to run a test for mongodb is just to invoke the testfile with
mongo shell:

    mongo <testfile.js> 

from mongo installation directory.

For example:

    mongo jstests/core/all.js

To run all the tests, you can have list of these commands in a script
and run the script. Sample script is run_tests in this directory.
